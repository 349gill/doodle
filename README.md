A task scheduler that uses Multi-level Queues. Stack: Python/Flask, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL.

Managing different tasks with varying deadlines and priorities can be difficult. Meanwhile, Operating Systems tend to do a pretty good job at scheduling processes. To us, these are tangential problems, and we came up with a solution by using a modified MLFQ Algorithm for scheduling real-life tasks inspired from the world of Operating Systems.
